## About Mockito and WireMock
What is Mocking ?
Mocks is nothing but an imitation. It simulates behaviour of a real component but in a more controlled manner.

Why Mocking ?
- Gives you an isolated environment for testing.
- Write the test for the resource that is not accessible.

## Wiremock
Wiremock is an open source library which can be used to mock HTTP-based APIs with ease. It creates an HTTP server which allows us to mock web services just like an actual server.

## Mockito 
Mockito is a mocking framework, an open source JAVA library that allows to create and configure mock objects. Using Mockito we can add dummy functionality to a mock object and use it in our tests.
